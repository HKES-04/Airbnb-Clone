### What I learned

In the implementation of this small project, my primary focus was on honing my React skills. I dedicated substantial effort to mastering the art of code organization by effectively dividing it into reusable components. Leveraging the power of props, I learned how to create versatile JSX code, allowing for the seamless reuse of components with different data sets. This approach not only enhanced code modularity but also minimized redundancy, promoting a more efficient and maintainable codebase.
